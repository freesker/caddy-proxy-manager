/**
 * Copy maplibre-gl's tile worker (and everything it imports) into
 * `public/maplibre/` so the browser can load it from a stable, self-hosted URL.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * maplibre-gl v6 stopped inlining its worker as a blob and now resolves a
 * separate `maplibre-gl-worker.mjs` at runtime from `import.meta.url`. That
 * lookup does not survive Turbopack bundling:
 *
 *   - `next dev`   → resolves to the page URL, so the HTML page is loaded as a
 *                    worker and the map renders as an empty ocean.
 *   - `next build` → resolves to the wrong dist file (the main bundle).
 *
 * Pointing maplibre at a bundler-emitted asset does not work either: the worker
 * is an ES module that imports `./maplibre-gl-shared.mjs`, and Turbopack emits
 * each dist file under a different content-hashed name without rewriting those
 * relative imports, so the sibling import 404s.
 *
 * Copying the worker's whole module graph verbatim keeps the relative imports
 * resolvable. `WorldMapInner.tsx` then calls `setWorkerUrl()` with this path.
 *
 * Runs from next.config.mjs so it covers `next dev`, `next build` and the Docker
 * build alike, under both Node and Bun, with no extra lifecycle script wiring.
